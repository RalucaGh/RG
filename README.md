# Education
I am a curious individual that loves to learn anything and everything. This has led to the following expensive hobby:

- I am currently studying an MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex and I dream of one day being able to understand complex Machine Learning Algorithms. 
- I have completed a BSc in Criminology and Psychology where I fell in love with Data and Statistics, and I tried to hone that by deep diving into database creation and data analysis with SQL. 
- Before any of these I got myself a nice shining nursing degree where I fell in love with science (and learned how to fix some boo-boos).

# Work Experience
I currently work with a national charity that specialises in communication and learning where I am responsible for the SharePoint Intranet development, Salesforce development and maintanance, WordPress, data analysis, training and support. I am also the defacto IT person :).

Previously I have worked as an Area Coordinator for large Online Retailer where I managed the day to day operations and a team of 35 to ensure a smooth running of business.
